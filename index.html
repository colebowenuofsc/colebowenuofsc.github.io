			<h1> About Me </h1> 
			<p>My name is Cole Jackson Bowen. I am working towards a bachelor of science in Economics with a double minor in Psycholgy and Business. I am on track to graduate in 2024 if I don't fail this class. I currently work at MOD Pizza in Woodhill Plaza. I run the oven and have become quite the pizza cook. I am currently dating a beautiful lady named Cayden Gunter and we have been together for over four years now. If she is able to not get on my nerves for two consecutive weeks I will go ahead and buy the ring. We'll see how that goes. In my free time, I enjoy working out, reading, playing instruments, and having a good time with my friends. I enjoy martial arts as a form of exercise and meditation. I am a current member at the Warrior Fitness dojo, although I have not been since my car broke down. Hopefully this is enough text to look good before your click see more. </p>

I am running out of things to say about myself, so I will talk about my commute. My car broke down shortly after the end of the fall semester and I was unable to afford to fix it. I purchased a bike instead, and have been biking from my apartment to campus. The ride is roughly 5 miles and takes about 30-40 minutes. The journey to campus is the hardest with many tough hills to climb. While at first miserable, I learned to appreciate the scenery of everyday life. I have yet to get a car because without payments, insurance, and maintanance I have been able to grow my savings accout. This will be important for getting that pretty girl I mentioned a ring.  </p>

			<h1> My Future Career Plans </h1> 
			<p>Honestly, not too sure. If you go to college to pursue Economics because you want to be an Economist, then go ahead and plan on going to grad school as well. I am not going to do that personally. I have interests in a couple of different career paths. One of which is wealth management. I consider myself a people person and would enjoy client based work. Another promising career may be in Banking.

If all else fails, I will either be a daytrader or a muscian. In highschool, I became very interested in singing and playing guitar. After a couple of years of practice, I started to book gigs at different bars and restaurants in my hometown. In my prime, I was underage hanging out in bars till late in the night having the time of life. Sadly, Covid put an end to this and I have not played much since then. I may also be a daytrader. While I never became super consistent, I have spent a couple of months trading stocks and crypto and learning to analyze charts.</p>
